I looked at one today and it mentions &quot;requires at least 3 years of xxxxx data analytics&quot; . (xxxxxxx = my company name). This makes me think they&#39;re looking for  current business/data analysis within the company and have domain knowledge.   Hopefully in a few months i can start applying.',\n",

So if it seems like it’ll get to this certain point in 25 years, actually because it’s improving *exponentially*, it’ll really get to that point in like 4-5 years, possibly less, that’s what I mean',\n",
